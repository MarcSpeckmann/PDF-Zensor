# PDF-Zensor
!![Tests](https://github.com/XxHalbfettxX/pdf-zensor/workflows/Build%20&%20Tests/badge.svg)

PDF-Zensor can be used to censor PDF-files. As such it strips annotations and metadata as  well  as  textual
and  graphical  content from the PDF-file. It can also partially censor PDF-files and highlight certain text
phrases.

The application comes with a set of predefined colors, however, individual colors  for  censoring  different
elements can be configured as well.

### Tech

PDF-Zensor uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [PDFBox] - The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF documents.
* [Picocli] - Command line interface
* [Log4J] - Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility.
* [Jackson] - In computing, Jackson is a high-performance JSON processor for Java.
* [Apache Commons] - Apache Commons is an Apache project focused on all aspects of reusable Java components.

And of course PDF-Zensor itself is open source.

### Installation

PDFZensor requires Java >= 11

Install the PDF-Zensor(work in Progress)

```sh
$ wget https://git.se.uni-hannover.de/swp1920/pdfzensor-2/-/jobs/artifacts/63-deploy/raw/solution/target/pdfzensor_0.815_all.deb?job=deploy
$ sudo apt install ./pdfzensor_0.815_all.deb
```

alternative:

```sh
$ alias pdf-zensor='java -cp "pdfzensor-jar-with-dependencies.jar" de.uni_hannover.se.pdfzensor.App
```
to create a temporary alias "pdf-zensor" which is valid for the current shell session.

### Todos

 - (Feature): Clipping of images and the like according to the current GraphicsContext
 - (Feature): Correctly censor inline drawings
 - (Feature): Remove watermark
 - (Feature): Correctly censor Chinese characters or similar
 - (Feature): Regex works across pages
 - (Feature): Detect line breaks
 - üêû ZCensoring of rotated text can be strange (since we merge text according to global coordinates and not according to local)
 - üêû Tokenizer cannot find tokens across the page boundary
 - üêû Annotations::getRect returns a wrong (?) Rectangle. Avoided by HighlightAnnotation::getQuads
 - üêû EOFException instead of a FileFormatException if no valid PDF was entered [error in PDFBox]
